# Documentation for CLARA

**CLARA** is short for **CL**uster **A**rchitecture **R**ecovery **A**ssistent.
CLARA can help by extracting component-based software architectures from applications deployed in Kubernetes clusters and exporting them into a visually appealing format.
Thus, IT-architects that need insights about the components _actually_ deployed in the Cluster can be assisted by using CLARA.

For details on the **_functionality_** of CLARA see the [concept page](./concept/index.md).  
For information on **_configuration options_** of CLARA see the [configurations page](./configuration/index.md).  
For information on the **_validation_** of CLARA's functionality see the [validation page](./validation/t2-reference-architecture/index.md) for the T2 Reference Architecture.
